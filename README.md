# geo-list

A simple tiny _PHP only_ version of awesome [umpirsky country, currency and language projects](https://github.com/umpirsky).

This package is used by [laravel-geo](https://github.com/kslimani/laravel-geo) and the main goal is to reduce dependencies size. _(ie: composer download time and size)_

The build script uses the following dependencies :

* [umpirsky/country-list](https://github.com/umpirsky/country-list)
* [umpirsky/currency-list](https://github.com/umpirsky/currency-list)
* [umpirsky/language-list](https://github.com/umpirsky/language-list)
